Hi! I am a biomedical engineer. Born and raised in Miami, FL until I left to the University of Florida for my undergraduate degree. At the University of Florida, I studied biomedical engineering and conducted research in Christine Schmidt's lab. After a great experience with research I decided to continue my education and persue a Phd in biomedical engineering. I found myself at Virginia Tech starting in Dr. Scott Verbridge's lab where I focused on host-microbe interactions in pancreatic cancer. Two highlights of this area was my work on **Fusobacterium nucleatum induces proliferation and migration in pancreatic cancer cells through host autocrine and paracrine signaling** which we published in Science Signaling and **Electro-antibacterial therapy (EAT) to enhance intracellular bacteria clearance in pancreatic cancer cells** published in Bioelectrochemisty. After my third year, Dr. Verbridge left academia to the National Institutes of Health where he is a program director. Following this I switched to Dr. Jenny Munson's lab for the remainder of my PhD. In Dr. Munson's lab, I worked on characterizing interstitial fluid flow in patients with pancreatic cancer from DCE-MR imaging. I intend to use this page as a way to share projects that interest me and anything else that may be on my mind.
